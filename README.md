#### Editor: Kyi Lei Aye

### Overview
This program is created for everyone who are working in every aspect of work and who want to know their weekly payment before and after deduction amount.

### How to use 
1. Download the program and run with the compiler.
2. Users are expected to fill some of the questions concerning weekly hours, health insurance, and 401k retirement plan to check their payment.

### Program Design and Structure
1. Declaring the variables to store input values in different types of variables (Used data type - char, integer, double)
2. Initializing constant double type to refer to stardard work hour a week
3. Taking user input 
4. Calculating the gross payment amount by the use of if-else statements
5. Calculating the net payment amount by using switch statement
6. Calculating the deduction amount 
7. Using magic formula to get the exact 2 decimal points
8. Outputting the program

### Problem Solving Algorithms
1. Calculate the Gross Income based on the number of hours 
2. Reduce the Union Due from gross income first
3. Reduce the health insurance deduction amount from gross income if the user choose the "self and other" option
